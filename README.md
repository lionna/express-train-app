- **User Roles and Permissions**: Support for multiple user roles, including regular users and managers. Users can view and manage their own orders, while managers have additional capabilities to oversee and manage all orders.
- **Ticket Booking System**: Users can search for rides, view detailed trip information, and book seats. The system currently supports booking only one ticket per transaction.
- **Order Management**: Users can view their past and upcoming orders. Managers can view and manage all orders, including the ability to cancel any active order.

The system provides a seamless experience for users and administrators alike:

- **Users** can:

  - Search for available rides.
  - View comprehensive details about trips.
  - Book seats on their chosen rides.
  - Manage their own orders, including viewing past and upcoming trips.

- **Managers** have additional capabilities:
  - **Access and Oversee All Orders**: Managers can view all orders within the system, regardless of the owner. This includes detailed information about each order, including user details and order status.
  - **Manage and Cancel Orders**: Managers have the authority to manage and cancel any active orders. They can initiate cancellations for any orders and handle necessary adjustments or updates to the order status.
  - **Order Cancellation**: Managers can cancel any active order by confirming the cancellation through a dialog that displays the order ID and customer name. The system updates the order status to "cancelled" and provides a success message to confirm the action.
  - **Order Status Monitoring**: Managers can track and monitor the status of all orders, ensuring proper management and resolution of any issues that may arise with active or past orders.
  - **Carriage Management**: Managers can add, update, or remove carriages. This includes setting parameters such as the number of rows, left and right seats, and carriage type.
  - **Ride Management**: Managers can create, modify, or delete ride schedules. They have the ability to adjust arrival and departure times, set dynamic pricing, and manage ride details.
  - **Route Management**: Managers can define and edit routes. This includes specifying stations, the order of stops, and associated schedules.

Overall, the application enhances the train travel experience by offering a user-friendly interface for booking and managing train journeys while providing managers with the tools needed for effective order administration.

### Features

- **Ride Search:** Users can search for available train rides between two stations, view ride details, and select seats.
- **Seat Booking:** Users can select and book seats on different carriage types.
- **Order Management:** Users can view and cancel their orders. Managers have broader access to view and manage all orders.
- **Carriage Visualization:** Display of carriage types with specific seating arrangements.

**Application Architecture**

![Admin page](doc/images/architecture.png)

The application is built using Angular, following a component-based architecture and state management with NgRx, allowing the development of scalable and modular web applications. Below are the key architectural principles and approaches used in the project.

### Component-Based Architecture

Angular applications are organized around components, which encapsulate both the logic and view templates. Each component is responsible for a specific part of the UI:

- **Reusability:** Components are divided into independent, reusable units, making them easier to maintain and test.
- **Modularity:** Components are grouped into modules (e.g., `AppModule`, `SharedModule`), improving code structure and enabling lazy loading of modules for performance optimization.

### State Management with NgRx

State management in the application is handled by NgRx, which is based on the Redux pattern:

- **Store:** All application state is stored in a single centralized store, simplifying the management of complex data.
- **Actions:** State changes occur through dispatching actions, making state updates predictable.
- **Reducers:** Reducers manage how the state is updated in response to actions.
- **Effects:** Effects handle side effects (e.g., API calls), ensuring that reducers remain pure.

This approach simplifies debugging and testing since the state can be easily tracked and restored.

### Routing

Angular uses the built-in Angular Router to manage navigation and routing between pages:

- **Lazy loading:** Modules are loaded on demand, reducing the initial load time of the application.
- **Guards:** Guards are used to protect routes and check access permissions before loading.
- **Route parameters:** Enables passing data via URLs, which is useful for dynamic pages.

### Internationalization (i18n)

The application uses the `ngx-translate` library for multi-language support:

- **Asynchronous loading of translations:** Translations are loaded dynamically via HTTP requests, allowing easy support for multiple languages without reloading the application.
- **Language switching:** Users can switch the interface language in real-time, improving the user experience.

### Interactive Maps with Leaflet

For map and geographic information display, the application uses Leaflet in combination with `ngx-leaflet`:

- **Interactive maps:** Users can interact with maps, add markers, retrieve information about locations, etc.
- **Flexible customization:** Leaflet supports various plugins for adding features like marker clustering and different map types.

### User Interface with PrimeNG

For building the UI, the application leverages the `PrimeNG` library, which offers a wide range of pre-built UI components:

- **Rich components:** Tables, forms, modal windows, and other UI elements enable rapid development.
- **PrimeFlex:** CSS utilities for building flexible and responsive layouts.

### Testing

The project uses Jest for testing components and services:

- **Unit testing:** Ensures coverage of component and service functionality, catching errors early.
- **Integration testing:** Verifies the interaction between components and services, ensuring the application's integrity.

### Code Style and Linting

The project maintains code quality and style using ESLint and Prettier:

- **ESLint:** Enforces best practices and prevents potential errors in the code.
- **Prettier:** Automatically formats code to maintain consistency across the development team.

### Git Hooks with Husky

To automate code checks before commits, Husky is used. It allows running tests, linters, and other scripts before each commit, helping to maintain high code quality and minimize errors during development.
